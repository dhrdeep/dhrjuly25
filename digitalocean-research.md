# DigitalOcean Spaces Research

Based on DigitalOcean documentation, here are the key requirements for making files accessible:

## S3 Compatibility
DigitalOcean Spaces is fully S3-compatible, using the same API endpoints and authentication methods as AWS S3.

## File Access Methods
1. **Public URLs**: Files can be made publicly accessible via direct URLs
2. **CDN URLs**: When CDN is enabled, files are accessible via CDN endpoints
3. **Signed URLs**: For private files, use pre-signed URLs with proper authentication

## Proper Configuration Steps
1. **Bucket Policy**: Set public read access via bucket policy
2. **Individual File ACLs**: Set public-read ACL on individual files
3. **CDN Configuration**: Enable CDN for improved performance

## Authentication Requirements
- Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are required
- Proper S3 signature version (v4) must be used
- Endpoint format: `https://{region}.digitaloceanspaces.com`

## Common Issues
- Files default to private access
- CDN may take time to propagate
- Incorrect endpoint configuration causes authentication failures
