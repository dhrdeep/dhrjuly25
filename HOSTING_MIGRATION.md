# VIP Music File Hosting Migration Guide

## Current Issue
Jumpshare requires browser-based authentication that can't be automated, preventing real audio file access.

## Recommended Solutions (Cost-Effective)

### 1. DigitalOcean Spaces (RECOMMENDED)
- **Cost**: $5/month for 250GB storage + bandwidth
- **Why**: S3-compatible, simple pricing, great for music streaming
- **Setup**: 
  - Create DigitalOcean account
  - Create a Space (bucket)
  - Get API keys
  - Upload your music files

### 2. AWS S3
- **Cost**: ~$0.023/GB/month + bandwidth
- **Why**: Most reliable, worldwide CDN
- **Setup**: Similar to Spaces but pay-per-use

### 3. Backblaze B2 (CHEAPEST)
- **Cost**: $0.005/GB/month
- **Why**: Lowest storage cost
- **Downside**: Slower than S3/Spaces

### 4. Cloudflare R2
- **Cost**: $0.015/GB/month, NO bandwidth fees
- **Why**: No egress charges, very fast
- **Best for**: High download volume

## What I've Built

✅ **Multi-Provider System**: Supports S3, Spaces, local files, and direct URLs
✅ **Automatic Fallback**: Tries new hosting first, falls back to Jumpshare
✅ **Easy Migration**: Add files gradually without breaking existing links
✅ **Database Ready**: Added new columns for alternative file sources

## Next Steps

1. **Choose a provider** (recommend DigitalOcean Spaces)
2. **Upload a few test files** to verify streaming/downloads work
3. **Provide API credentials** (I'll add them securely)
4. **Gradual migration** - test with 5-10 mixes first

## Environment Variables Needed

For DigitalOcean Spaces:
```
S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-region.digitaloceanspaces.com
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## Cost Estimate
For 1000 mixes (average 50MB each = 50GB):
- **DigitalOcean Spaces**: $5/month (fits in 250GB plan)
- **AWS S3**: ~$1.15/month + bandwidth
- **Backblaze B2**: $0.25/month + bandwidth
- **Cloudflare R2**: $0.75/month (no bandwidth fees)

**Current Jumpshare cost vs reliability**: Free but doesn't work programmatically
**Recommended**: Start with DigitalOcean Spaces $5/month - simple and reliable
