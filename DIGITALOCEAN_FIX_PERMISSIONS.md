# URGENT: DigitalOcean Space Permission Fix Required

## Current Problem
Your dhrmixes Space still returns 403 Forbidden errors even with CDN enabled. This means files are NOT publicly accessible.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION NEEDED

### Method 1: Make Individual Files Public
1. Go to https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/dhrmixes?path=%2F
2. For EACH MP3 file (01 mix sinitsa 22.mp3, etc.):
   - Click the file
   - Click "Make Public" or "Change Permissions"
   - Set to "Public Read"

### Method 2: Set Bucket Policy (Recommended)
1. Go to your Space Settings
2. Look for "Bucket Policy" or "Access Control"
3. Add this policy to make all files publicly readable:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::dhrmixes/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test URLs After Fix
- Direct: https://dhrmixes.lon1.digitaloceanspaces.com/01%20mix%20sinitsa%2022.mp3
- CDN: https://dhrmixes.lon1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/01%20mix%20sinitsa%2022.mp3

Both should return MP3 content, not XML errors.

## Current Status
❌ Files return 403 Forbidden
❌ CDN enabled but files still private
❌ VIP streaming/downloads broken

## Expected After Fix
✅ Files return MP3 content
✅ VIP streaming works
✅ VIP downloads work
