- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Vite for development and building
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

## Environment Setup
The project uses environment variables for configuration:
- `VITE_PATREON_CLIENT_ID`: Patreon OAuth client ID (frontend)
- `VITE_PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET`: Patreon OAuth client secret (frontend)
- `VITE_PATREON_REDIRECT_URI`: OAuth redirect URI
- `PATREON_CLIENT_ID`: Server-side Patreon client ID
- `PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET`: Server-side Patreon client secret
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (auto-configured by Replit)

## Key Features
- **Streaming Channels**: DHR1 (Premium), DHR2 (Exclusive DJ sets)
- **Track Identification**: AI-powered track recognition
- **VIP Access**: 1TB+ exclusive content library
- **Community Forum**: User discussions and music news
- **Merchandise Shop**: DHR branded products
- **Admin Panel**: User and subscriber management
- **Patreon Integration**: Subscription tier management

## Database Schema
- `users`: User accounts with subscription tiers and preferences
- `patreon_tokens`: OAuth tokens for Patreon integration

## User Preferences
- Follow security best practices with proper client/server separation
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Maintain clean, readable TypeScript code
- Keep database operations server-side for security
- Never use fake/mock/placeholder data - only real authenticated data from Patreon API
- Implement proper subscription expiration checking - deny access when subscriptions expire

- **Design Consistency**: Apply title case (Capital Letter At Start Of Every Word) for all text content
- **Typography**: Use font-black weight for main headings to maintain modern, bold appearance  
- **Simplicity Preference**: Keep implementations simple, use copy-paste approaches when they work effectively
- **CRITICAL**: Never delete or remove working functionality without explicit user permission
- **Navigation Flow**: "Enter The Deep" button scrolls to free media player (not Track Identifier)
- **Access Control**: Track Identifier requires paid subscription (DHR1/DHR2/VIP), VIP functions require VIP membership
- **Player Features**: Homepage player needs Pop Out and Sleep Timer buttons (no playback speed control)
- **Social Media**: Instagram @deephouseradio, Twitter/Facebook @deephouseradi0
- **Stream Quality**: Free=128kbps with ads, Premium=320kbps uninterrupted
